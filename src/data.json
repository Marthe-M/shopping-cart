        "description": "The iMac is range of Macintosh desktop computers designed and built by Apple Inc. It has been a large part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings since its introduction in 1998, and has evolved through four distinct forms. In its original form, the iMac was gum drop- or egg-shaped with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by colored, translucent plastic. The second major revision, the iMac G4, moved to a design with a hemispherical base containing all main components and an LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to the top of the base. The iMac G5 placed all the internal components immediately behind the display, creating a self-contained design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base. All subsquent Intel-based iMacs have followed this design, despite changes in materials and size. The current iMac shares the same form as the previous models, but is now slimmer and uses black-bordered glass and anodized aluminum for its case.",
